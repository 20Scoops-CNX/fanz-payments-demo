# PayLo Payments Demo

The PayLo API offers a wealth of data, which can be visualised in many different ways. Based on our experiences, we have assembled a set of example layouts for you to explore. They cover the basic views typically encountered on a hotel booking website. Take these as additional inspiration for your own visualization, and explore the source code to understand how to process an API response to get the most out of our service.

**You can see this demo app running in test mode on [demo.pay-lo.com](https://demo.pay-lo.com/).**
